- PARTICLE SCALER:

Tool:

- Window -> Mirza Beig -> Particle Scaler

Easy-to-use tool for scaling individual particle-component game objects, or even
complex hierarchies of particles. 

Use either the quick-scale buttons or set a custom scale using the slider and hit apply.
You can also scale the particles in real-time by enabling real-time scaling and dragging
the scale slider after that. Once clicked away from, real-time scaling is automatically
disabled for convenience.

Additionally, you can playback and preview the entire particle system(s) animation through the 
editor window.
